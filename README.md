# What is SikeCoin

<b>Introduction</b>
SIKE is a DeFi deflationary currency on BSC Network. SIKE is based on a meme, but it is not a token without a purpose, it is paired with actual products and use cases. We are trying to help BSC crypto investor with our products.

SIKE has a transaction fee of 5%. The 2% is going to be automatically redistributed to all HODLer, and the other 3% will be converted to generate liquidity.

We are dedicated, humble, smart, kind, fabulous community of people working together to achieve something big. Moon or mars ? we are confident and crazy enough to achieve that! So let's join our community and let us grow together.

Yup and we want to tell you something. This is no longer Dog era. It's time for Cat era.

SIKE will continue to grow steadily 'cause we have large community expanding everyday. And, we don't have a ridiculous amount of total supply because we aren't a fan of that. Soo, SIKE to 100$ will defo be possible. What's stopping us ? the sky's the limit.
